In this paper we presented a novel approach for automatically generating test cases, complete with test oracles, for mobile apps. It was motivated by a comprehensive study that we conducted of real defects in mobile apps. Through this study we identified a class of features called user-interaction features, which were implicated in a significant fraction of bugs and for which oracles could be constructed, in an application agnostic manner, based on our common understanding of how apps behave.  Our approach, as embodied by our tool \tool, includes an extensible framework that supports such domain specific, yet application agnostic, test oracles, and automatically generates a compact suite of test sequences,
including test oracles, to comprehensively test the user-interaction features of a given mobile app. Our initial experimental evaluation of \tool\ on $\NumApps$ open-source Android apps was quite promising: \tool{} found a total of $\NumBugs$ bugs, a few of them particularly serious, using a 
total of $\NumTests$ tests for these $\NumApps$ apps. 
For future work we would like to augment the set of oracles currently supported by \tool, evaluate it more extensively on a larger set of apps, and explore the possibility of extending our basic oracle generation approach beyond the set of user-interaction features reported in this work.
