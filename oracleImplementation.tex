\subsection{Feature-based Oracle Generation}
\label{sec:oracle}

\mukul{REDUNDANT: HAS BEEN MERGED INTO THE PREVIOUS SECTION}

Once test sequences are generated, we insert oracles by improving test sequences in two ways.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
Firstly, we automatically add appropriate instrumentation before and after performing actions (i.e., taking edges) in test sequences, so that they dynamically record details of the app at each state when the test is being run.
%\item 
Secondly, we automatically add oracles that compare the results of exercising features, as recorded by the previous instrumentation, and assert checks as dictated by feature oracles.
%\end{itemize}
